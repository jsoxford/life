# Prerequisites

* A relatively up-to-date installation of Python
* pip package manager


## Getting set up

Grab the client with `pip install coderetreat`

## Starting a session

Tests and code live in the same file. To get started you might use the following template:

```python
# TODO!
```

## Running tests

Run `cr path/to/my/session.py`. The client will watch the file for changes and print the results to the terminal. When your tests fail the details will also be printed.

## Writing tests

TODO!
